# Computational Geometry Unity Library


## Finished


### Tests

* Is a triangle oriented clockwise?
* Is a point left, on, or right of vector?
* Is a point left, on, or right of a plane?
* Is a point inside or outside a circle?
* Is a quadrilateral convex?


### Intersections

* Point in triangle
* Point in polygon
* Triangle-triangle
* AABB
* Rectangle intersection with Separating Axis Theorem (SAT)
* Line-line
* Ray-plane


### Convex Hull

* Jarvis March


### Triangulations

* Triangulate convex polygon
* Triangulate convex random points with "visible edge" and "point-by-point" algorithms
* Triangulate convex random points with delaunay triangulation - "point-by-point"
* Triangulate convex random points with delaunay triangulation - "triangulate and then flip all edges"
* Constrained delaunay triangulation


### Voronoi diagram

* Voronoi point-by-point (suffers from floating point precision issues)
* Voronoi from delaunay


## TODO

* Constrained dynamic delaunay triangulation
* Convex hull: Quick Hull from the Valve paper on Hull
* Convex hull: Gift wrapping
* 3d voronoi
* Marching cubes
* Voronoi - incremental 
* Cut 3d mesh with plane
